## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

The purpose of this file is to present a couple of basic plots using
`ggplot`.

First we create a dataframe containing variables for our plots.

``` r
set.seed(1234)

plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000, sd = .5),
  y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(1000)
)
```

First we show a histogram of the `x`
    variable.

``` r
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram()
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

Next we show a scatterplot of `y` vs `x`.

``` r
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
